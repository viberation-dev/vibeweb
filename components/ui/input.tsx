 * --card plate so a field reads as an object on the soft panels the member
 * screens are built from. A transparent field disappeared on them.
 *
 * The border stays for the pages whose ground is already --card (admin, and
 * the search results page), where a fill alone would leave no edge.
 *
 * Call sites that pin their own height still win: the header search keeps
 * h-9 and the folder field h-8.
